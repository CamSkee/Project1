# Project 1: Air Quality Data Analysis

**Client:** UNMC Water, Climate and Health Working Group

---

## Overview
This project analyzes air quality data collected from PurpleAir sensors across Nebraska. The purpose of the project is to organize and summarize air quality conditions and identify potential public health concerns related to particulate matter and other air pollutants.

The dataset includes daily air quality measurements collected between February 2024 and March 2025.

## Project Goals
- Summarize air quality data for locations across Nebraska
- Identify sensors with elevated PM 2.5, PM 10.0, and VOC values
- Determine when and where maximum pollutant levels occurred
- Evaluate air quality using EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) standards
- Explore how temperature, humidity, and sensor elevation relate to air quality
